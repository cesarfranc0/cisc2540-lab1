# Lab 1: Hello Godot by Cesar Franco

**Wash the Pibble** is a lighthearted game where you play as a playful puppy on a mission to get squeaky clean! The main goal is to chase down the soap as it bounces around the screen. Catching the soap helps your pibble (puppy) get cleaner while adding fun and challenge to the experience.

## ðŸ›  Some Development Notes  
This project was built as an exploration into creating a fun, small-scale game.  

- Setting up the **build environment** and creating **entities** was straightforward.  
- The only real question I encountered during development was how to **create a nested scene**. Once I figured that out, the rest of the process flowed smoothly.
